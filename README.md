# Snake-Game
This game is based on the C++ programing language. The game contains boundaries, a snake, and some random occurring fruits. In this, a snake can travel in any direction in search of fruits. After eating those fruits the snake becomes larger and new nodes are attached to it which act as a tail part and traverse in the same direction as the head of the snake.
